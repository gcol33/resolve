# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We aim to maintain an open, friendly, and professional environment within the **RESOLVE** project.
Everyone taking part (contributors, maintainers, and users) should feel welcome and respected, regardless of background, identity, or experience level.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a good environment:

- Communicating clearly and respectfully
- Being open to different opinions and approaches
- Offering constructive feedback
- Helping others learn and contribute
- Staying focused on collaboration and shared goals

Examples of behavior that is not acceptable:

- Personal attacks or insulting language
- Disrespectful or dismissive comments
- Sharing private information without consent
- Any form of harassment or hostility toward others

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and taking fair action when necessary.
They may edit, remove, or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct or disrupt collaboration.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including discussions, issues, pull requests, and any community interactions related to RESOLVE.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainer privately.
Reports will be handled with discretion, and maintainers will take appropriate action as needed.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, and simplified to better fit the tone of an open scientific software project.
