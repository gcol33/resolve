Title: Relational Encoding via Structured Observation Learning with Vector Embeddings
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(

Description: R interface to the RESOLVE C++ core for learning from many-to-one
    relational data (e.g., predicting soil properties from plant species
    composition, customer LTV from purchase history). Uses deep learning with
    feature hashing and learned embeddings. Provides a formula-based interface
    with data/obs pattern familiar to R users.
